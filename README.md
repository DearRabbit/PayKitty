Do remember to use 
```
npm install pack-name --save
```
for saving it in the dependencies list.

After cloning, run
```
npm install
```

>Node modules installed with the --save option are added to the dependencies list in the package.json file. Afterwards, running npm install in the app directory will automatically install modules in the dependencies list.
